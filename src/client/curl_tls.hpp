// Tell libcurl to consult the platform's native trust store (Windows Schannel,
// macOS keychain) at handshake time, regardless of which SSL backend it was
// built against.
//
// On Windows + vcpkg, libcurl is wired against OpenSSL, which only reads its
// compiled-in cert path — frequently a non-existent location on the user's
// machine. The result is every HTTPS request failing with
//
//     SSL peer certificate or SSH remote key was not OK
//
// even for certs signed by public CAs. CURLSSLOPT_NATIVE_CA flips libcurl to
// hand the OpenSSL backend the system trust roots, which is what every other
// HTTPS client on the box already does.
//
// No-op on libcurl versions that don't define the flag (added in 7.71 for
// Schannel, 7.81 broadly for OpenSSL). Safe to call on every easy handle
// before curl_easy_perform; cheap (just sets a flag).
